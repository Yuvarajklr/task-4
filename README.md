This project provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of how firewalls filter network traffic. It explains the various techniques.

### 🔍 Core Filtering Mechanisms

- *Packet Filtering*: Filters packets based on IP, port, and protocol.
- *Stateful Inspection*: Tracks connection states for more accurate filtering.
- *Application-Level Filtering*: Inspects application-level data like HTTP, FTP, etc.

### 🎯 Common Filtering Criteria

- *Direction-Based Filtering*: Inbound and outbound traffic control.
- *Port-Based Filtering*: Allow/block specific ports like 22 (SSH), 80/443 (HTTP/HTTPS).
- *Protocol-Based Filtering*: Filter by TCP, UDP, ICMP.
- *IP Address-Based Filtering*: Whitelisting/blacklisting IP addresses.

### ⚙️ Advanced Filtering Techniques

- *Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)*
- *Rate Limiting*
- *Network Address Translation (NAT)*

### 🧠 Firewall Decision-Making Process

1. Checks matching rules
2. Validates connection state
3. Applies default deny/allow policy
4. Logs the action (optional)

### ✅ Benefits

- Prevents unauthorized access
- Blocks malicious traffic
- Enables traffic monitoring and control
- Enhances network security posture
